# Basic-NLP
The project is based on basic Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this project, I just parsed a text file and visualized the words trend.

The focus of this project was to understand the basics of NLP and the initial process involved in such a project.

Two plots were developed that visualized the count of words.

The first plot was developed before data cleaning and the second was developed after the data cleaning.

Finally, the two plots were compared to see how data cleaning is important for such a project.

Python file and Project Report is shared in this repository.
